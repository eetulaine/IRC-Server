# ft_irc
## üìå Overview

ft_irc is a custom IRC (Internet Relay Chat) server written in C++ as part of the Hive Helsinki core curriculum. It implements the essential features of the IRC protocol ‚Äî allowing multiple clients to connect, join channels, exchange private messages, and manage channels with operator privileges. While no IRC client was developed for this project, we used Irssi as a reference client to connect, test, and verify the server‚Äôs functionality.

## üéØ Project Focus

  This project is designed to explore key aspects of network programming and real-time communication:
  - TCP socket programming
  - Event-driven I/O using epoll()
  - Parsing and processing text-based commands
  - Managing communication between multiple concurrent clients

## ‚ú® Features
#### Core IRC Server Functionality

   - Supports multiple simultaneous client connections (non-blocking sockets).
   - Handles authentication and registration via standard IRC commands: PASS, NICK, and USER.
   - Maintains active connections through continuous PING/PONG handshakes.
   - Properly handles client disconnections (QUIT, signal termination, or network failure).
   - Supports nickname changes with live updates to other connected users.
   - Allows private messaging between users.
   - Enables channel creation and group communication.

####  Channel Management

 - Supports channel topics and topic modification.
 - Manages operator privileges for channel owners.
 - Implements channel modes, including:
    - Invite-only (+/-i)
     - Key-protected (+/-k)
   - Topic restriction (+/-t)
   - User limit (+l)
 - Supports channel invitations and user kicks.

####  Logging

 - Clean, informative, and color-coded server activity log for easier monitoring and debugging.
